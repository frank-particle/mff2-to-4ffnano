BOM and Parts ordering
===

The BOM is so simple, there's no need for a separate CSV file:

- 4FF Nano SIM holder - [GCT SIM8051 (Active)](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/gct/SIM8051-6-0-14-01-A/9859628) or GCT SIM8100 (Obsolete)

Another way to order PCB's is by using the included [gerbers](gerbers/mff2-to-4ffnano-v1.0.zip) and uploading those with all of the necessary specs to companies like [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) or [OSHPark](https://www.oshpark.com)
